explanation: "The Tricuspid valve separates the Right atrium from the Right ventricle and the Mitral valve separates the Left atrium from the Left ventricle. Therefore, in order for the atria to fill the ventricles concurrently, the Mitral and Tricuspid valves must be open at the same time."

Explanation: "The audible noises heard in the heart sound is produced by the actual closing of valves. Therefore, S1 is the sound of the tricuspid and mitral valves closing and S2 is the sound of the pulmonary and aortic valves closing."

Explanation: "Systole is the part of the heart cycle just before S2 (which is can also be thought of as the part of the heart cycle between S1 and S2).  During systole, the pulmonary and aortic valves are open and the ventricles are pumping blood out of the heart."
