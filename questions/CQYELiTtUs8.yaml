            <p>The surface of the planet Lubricon VI, which has no atmosphere, is perfectly flat and smooth. So smooth, in fact, that no object experiences friction as it glides across the surface of the planet.</p>
            <p>At this very moment, a frozen sock is travelling across the surface at 1 km/h. What will happen to the sock? It will:</p>

            <p>Newton's First Law tells us that an object stays at a constant velocity unless it is acted upon by an unbalanced force.</p>
            <p>Image you're driving your car on the highway, just below the speed limit.</p>
            <p>In order to keep the car travelling at a constant velocity, you need to keep your foot on the "accelerator" so that the engine continues to burn fuel.</p>
            <p>What are the primary balancing forces that keep the car from accelerating forward in this situation?</p>

            <p>Imagine you are standing on a huge rock that is moving really fast through a large space, but at a constant velocity. All you can see is the ground you are standing on, and blue sky. There is no sun, stars or clouds. How can you tell if you are moving?</p>
